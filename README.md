## What is it?
CT Scan is an interesting mini Android application which simulates how a computer analyzes voxel data from a CT scanner.  
I was inspired to develop this application in order to replicate a simple CT scanning example illustrated on *Cambridge International AS and A Level Physics Coursebook*.  
If you want to know how that example looks like, you can either read it on the coursebook or read the source code of this application.

### Compatibility
This application is compatible with Android 4.2.x (API 17) to 7.1.x (API 25), and should not have problems with future Android versions or APIs.
